This is my submission for the coding test you sent me.

I coded the game using C++ and it is running as a console application. 

In this folder you can find a file "SecretNumbersMultiple.exe" under the "Release" folder to directly launch the game.
You can also find a file "SecretNumbersMultiple.cpp" under the "SecretNumbersMultiple" folder containing my implementation of the game.
