# WizcorpCodingTest

This is my submission for the coding test you sent me.

"The game generates 3 secret numbers between 1 and 10.
The goal of the player is to enter a number that is a multiple of the 3 secret numbers generated.
Each time the player inputs a number the game shows the player a result between 0 and 3
The result is determined by the amount of secret numbers that are a factor of the submitted number
The game ends when the player finds a multiple of all 3 secret numbers"

I coded the game using C++ and it is running as a console application. 

In this folder you can find a file "SecretNumbersMultiple.exe" under the "Release" folder to directly launch the game.
You can also find a file "SecretNumbersMultiple.cpp" under the "SecretNumbersMultiple" folder containing my implementation of the game.
